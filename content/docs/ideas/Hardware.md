These are project ideas that have some hardware component required.
### Headset Range

I have a wireless headset for my computer, but the coverage in my house is limited since my office is far to one side. My first thought was some sort of wireless repeater, but that seems too difficult because I don't really know anything about the signal. 

My next thought was plugging the dongle in somewhere else and sharing the connection with the PC. I found USB over IP and I plan to connect the dongle to a Raspberry Pi 0.

### Hologram

Using the Pepper's Ghost illusion, you can create a hologram. I want to use this on a small scale for notifications on my desk, or on a lager scale for 3D models. Using a pyramid shape, I should be able to show a different side of a 3D model on each side, then by rotating the model for all views, I think it should appear as spinning from all angles

### Home Audio

I currently have a Sonos surround sound setup and wanted to add more speakers around the house. A single Era 100 is $200 so I'm looking around for DIY solutions. It seems like I can use a SnapCast server and then a client on a raspberry pi with a DAC and whatever speaker.

### Smart Mirror

A smart mirror would allow me to have calendar display on my bathroom mirror so I can see upcoming events and know what I have planned for the day. This would involve getting 2-way glass, a monitor, and building a frame. High effort, low reward. I probably won't do this one anytime soon.
