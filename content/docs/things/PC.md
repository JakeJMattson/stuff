Since this was my second PC build I wanted to do something different. I chose to do an all-white build which was mountable on the wall. I chose the [Thermaltake Core P3](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/r6DzK8/thermaltake-core-p3-snow-edition-atx-mid-tower-case-ca-1g4-00m6wn-05) and a basic TV mounting bracket.
